	<h2>Cognitive Telescope Network</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="webapi/myresource">CTN Welcome Page</a>
	<p>The Cognitive Telescope Network (CTN) is a proposed global
		network of telescopes that would use artificial intelligence (AI) to
		autonomously coordinate observations of transient astronomical events.
		Such events include gamma-ray bursts, gravitational waves, and
		supernovae.</p>

	<p>The CTN would be able to rapidly respond to transient events,
		which is essential for studying them. For example, gamma-ray bursts
		only last for a few seconds, so it is important to observe them as
		soon as possible.</p>

	<p>The CTN would also be able to coordinate observations from
		multiple telescopes, which would provide a more complete picture of
		the event. For example, a gamma-ray burst could be observed by
		telescopes in different parts of the world to get a better
		understanding of its location and properties.</p>

	<p>The CTN is still under development, but it has the potential to
		revolutionize the study of transient astronomical events.</p>

	<p>Here are some of the benefits of the CTN:</p>

	<p>Faster response to transient events: The CTN would be able to
		autonomously coordinate observations of transient events, which would
		allow astronomers to study them much faster than they can today. More
		complete observations: The CTN would be able to coordinate
		observations from multiple telescopes, which would provide a more
		complete picture of the event. New discoveries: The CTN could enable
		new discoveries about transient astronomical events, as well as the
		universe as a whole. The CTN is a very exciting project, and I am
		looking forward to seeing how it develops in the future.</p>
